TODO
====

Things that still need doing or investigating:

* Can we use View.post(Runnable) instead of / as well as, Activity.runOnUiThread?

* Implement onPause, onStop, onResume etc on the activity.

* Sort out Object-Remote-Java versus JavaBridge naming

* Sort out package naming (uk.me.desert_island versus uk.me.jandj, or maybe even org.perlfoundation ?)

* Support more Activity events.
